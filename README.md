# Puzzle Hunt 2022

The Puzzle Hunt is an event originally hosted by two math students, Dennis Sweeney and Rushil Raghavan, in early 2020. This year, Oscar Coppola, Jay Ozello, and Torey Hilbert are bringing back the tradition by hosting another Puzzle Hunt. Participants receive a packet of 20 puzzles that point to some location on campus. After solving a puzzle, they travel to the location and find a secret phrase that they enter here. The event takes place across the majority of OSU campus east of the Olentangy.

Here is a link to the site in production: [https://puzzle-hunt-2022.netlify.app/](https://puzzle-hunt-2022.netlify.app/).

You also can find a PDF of the puzzles under [/assets/PuzzleHunt2022-Packet.pdf](/assets/PuzzleHunt2022-Packet.pdf).

This website serves as an automatic scoreboard, allowing all teams to view a live scoreboard, along with a precise listing of which teams have solved which puzzles. It additionally contains two of the puzzles that didn't fit well into print format.

For technical details, JAMstack is used with a React frontend, Netlify serverless functions, and FaunaDB database.

We hope to run this event again next year!
